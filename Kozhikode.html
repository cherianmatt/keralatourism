    	<h1><b>Kozhikode</b></h1>
    	<p>Calicut, also known by the name Kozhikode, is a northern district located on Indiaâ€™s south-west coastal belt. The headquarters of this district is also known by the same name i.e. the city of Calicut. Surrounded by the Arabian Sea in the west, this region was the glorious centre of trade and commerce in the bygone era. According to modern day historians, Calicut was best known for its spices and silk - a reason why it had successfully established trade links with many countries in the Indian Ocean. Strong commercial links with many African, Asian and Middle East countries made Calicut a buzzing economic hub in its golden days.Of all the things Calicut is famed for, its culture and cuisines stand out demanding the attention of travellers and historians alike. This region is the birthplace of the world famous folk songs known by the name Vadakkan Pattukal. Calicut thrives with rich Islamic art forms which contributed to the uniqueness of the cultural history of the region. Oppana (a Muslim dance form) and Mappilapattukal (Muslim Songs) and Gazals are the most popular Islamic art forms of this place. The city is home to many progressive literary movements which gave birth to several renowned regional writers. Apart from cultural forms, the people of Calicut are well known for their love for football and hospitality.
