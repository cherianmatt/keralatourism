      <h1><b>Pathanamthitta</b></h1>
      <p>A hilly province of pristine splendour, the district of Pathanamthitta is hailed as the headquarters of pilgrim worship in Kerala. Three rivers course through its prosperous terrains comprising natural divisions of the lowlands, the midlands and the highlands. Interspersed with temples, rivers, mountain ranges and coconut groves, more than fifty per cent of the total area of this region is covered by forests.

Pathanamthitta has been dubbed a Heritage Village as it attracts visitors from all over the world for its spectacular water fiestas, religious shrines and cultural training centres. Pathanamthitta is also home to the unique AranmulaKannadi - metal mirrors that are meticulously handcrafted and the VasthuVidyaGurukulam, a village which practices the ancient Indian school of architecture.The district's name is a combination of two Malayalam words, pathanam and thitta, which together mean 'array of houses on the river side'.[6] The district capital is located on the banks of the river Achankovil.The district can be divided into three natural geographical regions: the highland, the midland and the lowland. The highland stretches through the Western Ghats, where the hills are tall and covered with thick forests. Western Ghats maintains an average altitude of around 800 m. It descends to the smaller hills of midland in the centre and finally to the lowland. The lowland with its abundance of coconut trees, lies along the eastern borders of Alappuzha district.
