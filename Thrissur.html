      <h1><b>Thrissur</b></h1>
      <p>
        The fourth largest city in Kerala, Thrissur or Trichur is the ‘Cultural Capital’ of God’s Own Country. The once a capital of the Kingdom of Cochin, this metropolis is a plethora of history, rustic cultures, devout beliefs, and colourful traditions.

Known to be one of the most pious tourist destinations in Kerala, this scenic city is dotted with pious temples, and is a home to some of the most gala festivals in the entire state. The city also serves as an ideal destination to learn Hindu religion.

Tracing back the history of Thrissur, it has been found that the city was one of the earliest human settlements in the country. Researchers and historians got evidences of early human settlements around sites like Ramavarmapuram, Kuttoor, Cherus, and Villadam. Trichur also served as an important trade centre during the medieval period, and was ruled by the Dutch rulers, Hyder Ali, Tipu Sultan, East India Company, and finally came to the hands of the Indian Government.Thrissur’s  Vadakkunnathan temple is an important temple for Shaivites. As a result, Thrissur has always been a place of religious significance to the Hindus. The Shaktan Thampuran palace, and the Guruvayoor temple are other places to visit for people who like learning about history.

Chimmony Wildlife Sanctuary, Thrissur Zoo and the Athirapalli Waterfalls are places that will take you closer to nature.

The Thrissur pooram festival, which is one of the most spectacular festivals of Kerala, is also hosted here.
