    	<h1><b>Kottayam</b></h1>
    	<p>Kottayam is an ancient city of Kerala. It is located in Kottayam district, one of the districts of the God’s Own Land. The city has a big contribution to print media and literature and hence rightfully referred as ‘Akshara Nagari’ meaning ‘city of letters’. Kottayam got its name from the word ‘Kottayam’ which is a combination of the Malayalam words ‘kott’ meaning ‘fort’ and ‘akam’ meaning ‘inside’; the literal meaning being ‘the interior of a fort’.Owing to its natural beauty and its rich cultural heritage, Kottayam has been a popular tourist destination. Thousands of tourists come to this city every year to relax and to experience the opulent cultural values of Kerala. The Poonjar Palace is an example of the rich culture of Kerala. Kottayam has many temple and shrines to be discovered by visitors. The Thirunakkara Mahadeva Temple, Pallippurathu Kavu, Thiruverpu Temple and the Saraswathy Temple are some famous temples situated in proximity to Kottayam. The Subramanya Swami Temple of Kottayam is one of the few temple dedicated to Lord Subramanya in Kerala. The ancient Thazhathangady Juma Masjid and the old St. Mary's Orthodox Church Kottathavalam attract many devotees every day. The cave at Kottathavalam is another tourist hotspot.
