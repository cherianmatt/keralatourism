      <h1><b>Palakkad</b></h1>
      <p>Palakkad, otherwise known by its anglicized name Palghat, is a district in Kerala that lies along the serpentine mountain ranges of the Western Ghats. What makes Palakkad distinct from other parts of Kerala is its predominantly rural nature coupled with enormous expanses of paddy fields. Endless stretch of palm trees, green carpeted landscapes, dense tropical forests and undulating hilly terrains make Palakkad a visual treat to spectators. By contributing massively to the rice production of Kerala, Palakkad has rightfully grabbed two titles - ‘The Rice Bowl of Kerala’ and ‘The Granary of Kerala’.Palakkad is credited with a good number of sightseeing options including forts, temples, dams, wildlife sanctuaries, waterfalls, parks and picturesque landscapes. Palakkad Fort and Jain Temple are of significant historical interest and draws travellers throughout the year. Malampuzha dam and gardens, along with the amusement park situated in the area, serve as an excellent picnic spot. Nelliampathi Hill Station, Silent Valley National Park and Parambikkulam Wildlife Sanctuary offer nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts with a delightful holidaying experience. Kanjirapuzha, Dhoni Waterfalls, Ottapalam, Kollengode Palace and Thenkurussi are other prominent destinations that demand a visit.
